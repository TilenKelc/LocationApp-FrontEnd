## Location App

This React.js app allows you to search 2 cities. It allows you to search the cities using the Autocomplete Api. The cities are then saved inside an array. You can remove them from the array. When you hit the CheckLocations button, it will send the coordinates of these 2 cities to the backend Api, made i node.js. The backend will then return the locations inbetween, that have the best weather based on temperature. The app then shows these locations including the first 2 on the Here Maps map. 

To work, this app uses:
- yarn, 
- node.js
- react.js

Frontend design looks like this:
